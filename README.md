I failed a few times to set up the code highlight theme. So I decide to write down Markdown texts within a software `MacDown` and save them into a directory `_macdown`, then convert them into HTML by `MacDown` and save those HTML files into a directory `_posts`, which could be collected and displayed by `Jekyll`.
