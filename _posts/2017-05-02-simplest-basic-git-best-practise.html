It is very cheap and recommended to create a new brach any time when you are creating a new feature or just making a hotfix.

<h2>checkout</h2>
create a new branch: 

{% highlight bash %}
git checkout -b ${branch_name}
{% endhighlight %}

or,  create a local branch tracing a remote branch:

{% highlight bash %}
git checkout ${remote_branch_name}
{% endhighlight %}


<h2>rebase</h2>
 then you are going to be in the branch. If you are about to stay in the branch a long time, do not forget to rebase the main branch <b>every time</b> when you start to work.

{% highlight bash %}
 # [in your branch]
git fetch
git rebase origin/development
 
 
# If you or someone else has pushed into this branch, you also have to rebase those work:
git rebase origin/${branch_name}
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>merge back</h2>
when you finish the work in the branch, it is better to make a <b>pull request</b> and then after the pull request is confirmed, the code would be auto merged by Github.
Otherwise, you can merge back your code to 'development' yourself when you are quite sure about what you are doing.

{% highlight bash %}
git checkout development
git merge ${branch_name}
git push origin development:development
{% endhighlight %}

please do not be hurry to delete your branch. It is not late to do it when your code is running totally successful in production.
